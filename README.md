# Neural Networks and Tensor Formats for High Dimensional Approximation

This repo only provides links to google colabs for the TUB lecture.

The Neural Network part is adapted from Alexander Hinneburg's notebooks to go along with Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning". The originals can be found here: https://gitlab.informatik.uni-halle.de/apyae/PRML/-/tree/master

The first notebook contains 1D regression examples for Feedfoward Neural Networks.

The second notebook contains high dimensional approximation examples which are treated both with a (deep) Neural network as well as a functional Tensor Train class.
The Tensor Train class is built from the ground up, while the NN uses PyTorch's inbuilt methods.
